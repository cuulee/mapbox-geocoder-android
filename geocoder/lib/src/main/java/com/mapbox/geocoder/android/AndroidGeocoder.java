/**
 * A class for handling geocoding and reverse geocoding.  Geocoding is
 * the process of transforming a street address or other description
 * of a location into a (latitude, longitude) coordinate.  Reverse
 * geocoding is the process of transforming a (latitude, longitude)
 * coordinate into a (partial) address.  The amount of detail in a
 * reverse geocoded location description may vary, for example one
 * might contain the full street address of the closest building, while
 * another might contain only a city name and postal code.
 *
 * The Geocoder class requires a backend service that is not included in
 * the core android framework.  The Geocoder query methods will return an
 * empty list if there no backend service in the platform.  Use the
 * isPresent() method to determine whether a Geocoder implementation
 * exists.
 *
 * Note: We only replicate the API of the original Android Geocoder class.
 * Implementation is our own.
